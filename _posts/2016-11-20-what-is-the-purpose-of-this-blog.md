**Brace yourself...**

Yes [I](/about) am really doing this! 

The internet is full of professional writters, so why bother? Well for starters we all have our own path to follow and life stories to tell and I am willing to share mine. Sharing some of my experiences my help someone get over their hurdle(s). Besides the point, you'll never stop learning, so let us do this then - time to take the plunge. The interesting thing is that the thought of doing a blog has been pounding in my head for sometime now. So with that said, I am just scratching that itch.

To be fair, I am not a professional blogger. I'm merely using this platform to grow, learn and share interesting facts not only about my life by also of others.

While I am scratching my itch, I am hoping to share life stories and information I personally find to be of significant value. Knowing the information is one thing, but expressing it to someone other than yourself may be a different thing. It will be a challenge, but I'm curious to know what I do and don't know :), and as *[Albert Einstein once said:](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins383803.html)*

> If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.

So enjoy and feel free to reach out and provide feedback.

Thanks!
