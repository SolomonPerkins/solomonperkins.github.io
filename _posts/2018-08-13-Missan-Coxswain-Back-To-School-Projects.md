Past Residents of Coxswain Community,

Greetings one and all! I do hope you and your family are in good health and are enjoying God's richest blessings. This public letter is directed to all the past residents of Coxswain Community and the surrounding communities.



**What is Aunty Missan Doing?**
!["Package"](/images/blog/missan-back-to-school-2.jpg "Package")
<br/>
For the past **five** years, Missan has been secretly organising a back-to-school program for students residing in the community. Ever since she started the back-to-school event, there has been an increase in the number of students who have benefitted. This event is often held twice during the summer, but due to financial constraints she is finding it challenging to organise the event this summer and as such, she is seeking assistance/support.  

<br/>
It is a well thought out program, geared towards ensuring that students start the academic year on the right foot. She donates a wide range of items, from school utensils to hygienic products, packaged based on age group or class. Here are examples of the different packages based on grade classification:

1. Students moving from Basic to primary receives:

- 1 small book cut in 2.
- 1 pencils
- 1 sharpener
- 1 eraser

2. Students going to grades 3-4 receives:

- 2 books
- 2 pencils
- 1 sharpener
- 1 eraser
- 1 shoe police
- 1 toothbrush

3. Students for higher grades receives (image above):

- 2 hardcover books
- 1 deodorant (roll-on)
- 1 shoe polish
- 1 pen
- 1 handkerchief (for girls)

You can clearly see that she is doing an excellent job of ensuring that no student is left behind.

<br/>
In the first year, she helped about 30 students, last year she assisted **77** students from this and surrounding communities. It is clear that parents are finding it difficult to purchase all the items required for back-to-school and her program is of great benefit. This is not just a handout event, she also imparts knowledge to the students through guest volunteers.

**Who Is Aunty Missan?**
<br/>
If you're a past resident of the community and don't know/remember Missan, let me jog your memory. She lives at "Wood", it is on the turn-off after passing the Light In the Valley church - Next to Natty house. She is the mother of Rena and Stella.. I do hope that jogged your memory. Either way, she is a remarkable role model in the community doing her best in helping the less fortunate as much as she can.

I can personally attest to her love for the community as I grew up a few chains away from her house. One thing is certain, she loves kids and her actions over the past five years speaks volume.



**We Need Your Assistance Please..**
<br/>
I got word about her secret back-to-school about three weeks ago. I believe it is incumbent upon me to share her work and to do my part in helping her gather the much-needed funds. Based on my conversation with her, this year has proven to be challenging and she is in NEED of your help for the program. The photo above, is an "empty" box, providing clear evidence that she is in need of assistance ASAP. 


I am therefore asking for your support in whatever way possible - cash or kind. If you reside in another country, I recommend you send cash via MoneyGram or Western Union - instructions below. However, if you send materials via Jamaica Customs - we will experience major challenge during the clearing process as a result of recent government policies ([exhibit A](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Customs-duties-in-Jamaica-among-world-s-highest_19222744){:target="_blank"}, [exhibit B](/images/blog/missan-back-to-school-4.jpg){:target="_blank"}). If however you are living in Jamaica, please feel free to contact me or Aunty Missan - instructions below.

As stated earlier, this is a yearly event and if you are unable to contribute, please do so when you can as she is in need of support for the next academic year. Thank you in advance. Please note that all funds or items received will go directly towards helping the students.

**Who Am I?**
<br/>
!["Who Am I"](/images/blog/missan-back-to-school-3.jpg)
Maybe I'm too young for your memory however, I do assume most folks would know who I am. In short, I grew up in the community with my dad, Sunny. Above is a photo of me with my dad sometime last year - yes I'm no longer the short guy.

Re: Who Am I School Program, I'm just the mouth-piece for Aunty Missan's program. My main objective is to help her receive funding for her program. I do believe that her work is very much needed for the next generation and so we should do our best in helping them. 

For security purposes, I do recommend you contact me so I can share Aunty Missan details with you via any of the following:

1. Email: socialgames111@gmail.com
2. Phone/WhatsApp: (876)848-7873
3. Twitter: [@DAlexForce](https://twitter.com/DAlexForce)

All funds should be sent in Aunty Missan's name (please contact me for her full details) as she will be the person handling the cash or items.

<br/>
<br/>
I thank you for your support and I'll be doing a follow-up post to share how this year went along with photos - if God spear life.


Thanks once again.
