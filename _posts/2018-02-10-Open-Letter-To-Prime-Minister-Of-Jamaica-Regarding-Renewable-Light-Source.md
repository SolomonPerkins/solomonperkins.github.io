Dear Honorable Andrew Holness,

This letter is in support of the program aimed at replacing traditional light sources with safe alternatives for residents living in vulnerable communities. In reference to the tweet/press release dated, January 27, 2018 (shown below),

... I wish to share my practical experience with renewable-light source and the beneifts I've noticed. But first I wish to express condolences to all the families & friends who being affected by fire. Let us work together in building a safer Jamaica.

<br/>
I'm from the parish of Clarendon, Chapelton Rock River to be exact, where farming is the primary source of income for the population. As with any rural community, traditional light sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and bottle torches is the most reliable backup solution in the event of power failure. However for less fortunate members, this is these are their only source of lighting.

<br/>
My practical experience with solar lights came as a result of using two types of solar powered light: a mini-solar system and a solar powered flash light. Both have shaped our (my father & I) lives for the better and I wish to share their benefits. 

In a nutshell, here are the two products.

<br/>
The mini-solar system as shown in the diagram above is a fully functioning 10W robust system with the ability of:

1. Powering up to three LED light bulbs for one night.
2. Recharging mobile devices.

As with all solar system, it will recharge the internal battery with power generate from the solar panel. The 2-piece design makes it an ideal product for small families. From a safety standpoint, family members won't experience any form of electrical shock as it outputs low DC power. At our house, we were able to use it to power the verhanda lighting throughtout the night while charging two cell phones. 

<br/>
The next best option is either a solar flashlight or solar lanters. Based on the need, they can provide adequate lighting necessary to do basic tasks for adequate periods. Unlike the mini-solar system, these are more portable and light weight but less powerful. I believe these items are ideal when the power goes out or the occational visit to a dark area, but I don't recommend these as a main source of lighting. This is due to the rate of recharge maybe dismal. This then becomes a challenge if it is the main source of lighting.


<br/>
In closing, I do recommend both as a replacement for the traditional kerosene and bottle torch. The mini-solar system is ideal to light up the main areas while the solar flashlights or lantern for travelling through dark areas. For additional details, I recommend reaching out to Food for the Poor, as they are offering the mini-solar system as part of their housing project.

<br/>
Thanks.
