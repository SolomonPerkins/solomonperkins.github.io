!["Church And Money"](/images/blog/money-bible.jpeg "2020 Year In Review")

<br/>
Over the past few years, I've carefully observed how money has been influenced the church. Globally, this has been a growing cause for concern. While this is not a comfortable topic for most believers, I believe in tackling the challenges of lives head-on. Becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable is a critical pre-requisite to growth.

I grew up in the church, SDA (Sevent Day Adventist) to be exact. This institution has played a pivotal role in my belief system. While they're some wonderful benefits of being a part of this community, I wish to call out a discuss a chalenge facing the church. My intention is to share my thoughts on a matter which has been brewing for the past 5 years: money and the church. Sharing my perspective on this matter and my recommendation is sole purpose with the end goal of making the institution better.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What The Good Book Says**

<br/>

The Bible speaks strongly about the church and money. It clearly states that the church should be a house of prayer and not a marketplace/business (Matthew 21:13). It even highlight one of the key principles of how the gospel should be shared: leave your wallets (Luke 9:3). 

The people of the faith are called to be different in all aspects of their lives - physical and spiritual. Therefore members are called to be different from the world/society. This covers all facets of life, inluding **money management**.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**How The World Operates**

<br/>
The world operates on a simple principle of services and rewards. An individual or entity provides a service, or adds value and consequently, a tangible monetary reward is issued.

<br/>
This social contract has signifant influence on our passion, motivation, life goals, and our interaction with others. If you disagree, I'll ask this basic question: Would you be willing to pursue higher education if there was no upside (financial reward) to it? While the means don't justify the ends, it certainly influences the path we take. 


<br/>

> Money truly answers all things.

<br/>


So the church was called to be "in the world but not of the world" (John 17:16-26). In plain terms, the church should be **different**. The level of influence money has on the church should be **different** from all organizations (for-profit/non-profit). Since businesses operate on a fundamental principle of providing goods/services and in turn, require payment of such. The Goods and services flow in one direction, while money flows in another. From a psychological standpoint, this model shouldn't be associated with the church. **The church should be the GREATEST and the MOST influential organization in any society** [period].

<br/>
Having read a huge portion of the Bible, meditated on God's words, and reflecting on my past experiences. I'd like to make the case that the church has deviated from its mandate.

**How The Church Should Operate**

<br/>
 
 > Malachi 3:10 states that we should work together. 
 
 "Bring all the tithes into the storehouse", simply means that we should bring all the resources we have under God's storehouse. Pooling resources together for the betterment of all is what the Lord is saying - "... that there may be food in my house". We should be united on one accord, and for one purpose - all for one and one for all.

This approach would allow all members to have access to these resources as needed. Consider the ants, they store up food accessible by all. The same principle should apply to the church. In plain terms:

> The church should be a multi-purpose entity providing interest-free loans, healing (spiritual & natural), and counseling to all its members.

Life happens and we may fall on hard times at some point in our lives - the Bible says there is a time and place for everything (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8). If a member is going through a hard time the church should be there to provide support (**including financially**). Once that member gets back on good footing, they should pour back into the storehouse/church **including repayment of the interest-free loan**. Can you imagine the impact such a life-changing testimony can have on the body of Christ? Wow! The ripple effect will draw even unbelievers to God. The Lord is a place of refuge, a strong tower in times of trouble. Amen (Proverbs 18:10). 

Since humans are susceptible to sin (corruption), the protection of these resources should be delegated to the Holy Spirit and the angels. The Lord has proven that we can put our trust in him and this resource is no exception (Malachi 3:10). Remember Ananias and his wife (Acts 5:3)? They lied to the Holy Spirit and ended up suffering the consequences. Therefore, we can rest assured that anyone we put in authority to govern these resources shall fear the King. __If the church [TRULY] walks in God's perfect will, the Lord guarantee that all dishonesty, theft, covetousness shall be revealed__.


<br/>

**Benefits**
<br/>

I firmly believe with all my heart that this is possible. If there is unity amongst the believers then some of these remarkable benefits can flow in our lives, families, and communities:

1. Everyone can act as a witness for every $1 that enter and leave the storehouse.
2. The Holy Spirit will be the mediator and judge of all resources. Remember the earth is the Lord's and everything in it (Psalm 24:1).
3. Valuable resources (money) will remain in the community to help them grow and flourish.
4. The public will no longer see the church as a business entity. Instead as the institution focus solely on Godly principles. Ultimately attracting new long term members.
5. The church would actually "leave their wallets" and spread the word freely without any worry or fear.
6. God would allow the church to live a lifestyle inline with his kindom principles.
7. People would worship God out of love and interest, not out of despiration.

**Disclaimer**

<br/>

Since it is natural for us (humans) to discredit disruptive or controversial ideas, I'll add a few disclaimers.

I'm not a "Pharisee" nor a "scribe". I'm not a minister, nor do I have any qualifications in pastoral ministry.

I'm just another member of society who grew up in the church. Having experienced the migration of resources from the haves to the haves-not, combined with the gradual migration of citizens, I believe the church has contributed to this (directly or indirectly). In simple terms, I've seen members consistently bring all their goods into the storehouse. After they fell on hard times (eg. COVID), there is no meat in God's house to sustain them and their families. I'm therefore asking this question: is this what God wants from us?

It is unsustainable to have such an important resource (money) flowing in one direction when God calls us to be different. If I, an average "joe" noticed the erosion in the trust and credibility of the church, then I believe others may have similar thoughts. 

I rather question our current affairs and let the Lord correct my ill-thoughts than be silent and become complicit. Since we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves, my question to us is: Can you get financial support from your church if you've fallen on hard times without the need to raise additional funds?

Take care until then and one love.
