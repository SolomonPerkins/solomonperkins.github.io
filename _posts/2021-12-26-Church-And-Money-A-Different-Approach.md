!["Church And Money"](/images/blog/money-bible.jpeg "2020 Year In Review")

<br/>
Over the past few years, I've carefully observed how money has been influenced the church. This has become a cause of concern across the globe. While this is not a comfortable topic for most believers, I believe in tackling the challenges of lives head-on.

I grew up in the church, SDA (Sevent Day Adventist) to be exact. This institution has played a pivotal role in my belief syste. While they're some wonderful benefits of being a a part of this community, I wish to call out a next step for this global community. With that said, I hereby share my thoughts on a matter which has been brewing for the past 5 years: money and the church.

My sole purpose is to question the current approach of the church and provide a recommendation with the aim to make it better.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What The Good Book Says**

<br/>

The Bible speaks strongly about the church and money. It clearly states that the church should be a house of prayer and not a marketplace/business. It even illustrates the key principle of how we should spread the gospel: leave your wallets. 

The people of the faith are called to be different in all aspects of their lives. Therefore we are called to be different from the world/society. How we manage money is no exception.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**How The World Operates**

<br/>
The world operates on a simple principle of services and rewards. An individual or entity provides a service or adds value and consequently, a tangible monetary reward is issued.

<br/>
This social contract has a major influence on our passion, life goals, and how we interact with others. If you disagree, I'll ask this one question: would you be willing to pursue higher education if there was no upside (financial reward) to it? While the means don't justify the ends, it certainly influences the path you'll take. 


<br/>

> Money truly answers all things.

<br/>


So the church was called to be "in the world but not of the world". In plain terms, the church should be different. The level of influence money has on the church should be different from all organizations. Businesses operate on a fundamental principle of providing a service and in turn, require payment of such. Goods and services flow in one direction, while money flows in the other. From a psychological standpoint, this model shouldn't be associated with the church. **The church should be the GREATEST and the MOST influential organization in any society** [period].

<br/>
Having read a huge portion of the bible, meditated on God's words, and reflecting on my past experiences. I'd like to make the case that the church has the wrong modus operandi.

**How The Church Should Operate**

<br/>
"Bring all the tithes into the storehouse", simply means that we should bring all the resources we have under this organization. Pooling resources together for the betterment of all is what the Lord is saying. We should be united on one accord, and for one purpose - all for one and one for all.

This approach would allow all members to have access to these resources as needed. Consider the ants, they store up food accessible by all. The same principle should apply to the church. In plain terms:

> The church should be a multi-purpose entity providing interest-free loans, healing (spiritual & natural), and counseling to all its members.

Life happens and we may fall on hard times at some point in our lives - the Bible says there is a time and place for everything. If a member is going through a hard time the church should be there to provide support (**including financially**). Once that member gets back on good footing, they will pour back into the church **including repayment of the interest-free loan**. Can you imagine the impact such a life-changing testimony can have on the body of Christ? Wow! The ripple effect will draw even unbelievers to God. The Lord is a place of refuge, a strong tower in times of trouble. Amen. 

Since humans are susceptible to sin (corruption), we delegate the protection of these resources to the Holy Spirit. The Lord has proven that we can put our trust in him and this resource is no exception. Remember Ananias and his wife (Acts 5:3)? They lied to the Holy Spirit and ended up suffering the consequences. Therefore, we can rest assured that anyone we put in authority to govern these resources shall fear the King. __If the church [TRULY] walks in God's perfect will, I guarantee you that all dishonesty, theft, covetousness shall be revealed__.


<br/>

**Benefits**
<br/>

I firmly believe with all my heart that this is possible. If there is unity amongst the believers then some of these remarkable benefits can flow in our lives, families, and communities:

1. Everyone can act as a witness for every $1 that enters and leave the storehouse.
2. The Holy Spirit will be the mediator and judge of all resources. Remember the earth is the Lord's and everything in it.
3. Valuable resources (money) will remain in the community to help them grow and flourish.
4. The public will no longer see the church as a business (service entity). Instead as the institution focus solely on Godly principles. Ultimately attractive new members.
5. The church would actually "leave their wallets" and spread the word freely without any worry or fear.

**Disclaimer**

<br/>

Since it is natural for us (humans) to discredit disruptive or controversial ideas, I'll add a few disclaimers.

I'm not a "Pharisee" nor a "scribe". I'm not a minister, nor do I have any qualifications in pastoral services.

I'm just another member of society who grew up in the church. Having experienced the migration of resources from the haves to the haves-not combined with the gradual migration of citizens, I believe the church has contributed to this (voluntary or otherwise). In simple terms, I've seen members consistently bring all their goods into the storehouse. After they fell on hard times (eg. COVID), there is no meat in God's house to sustain them and their families.

It is unsustainable to have such an important resource (money) flowing in one direction when God calls us to be different. If I, an average "Joe" noticed the erosion in the trust and credibility of the institution, then I believe others may have similar thoughts. 

I rather question our current affairs and let the Lord correct my ill-thoughts than be silent and become complicit. Since we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves, my question to us is: 

Can you get financial support from your church if you've fallen on hard times?

Take care until then and one love.
