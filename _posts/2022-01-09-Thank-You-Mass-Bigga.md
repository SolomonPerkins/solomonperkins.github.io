<br/>
The story I'm about to tell you is my experience of my other father and mentor, Winston Powell (Bigga), and how he has shaped my life. To all the family members, please accept this article as my deep gratitude for his monumental contribution to my life.

Hi! My name is Solomon Perkins (aka. Petah or little soldier), I grew up in a one-room wooden shack with my biological father. Bigga's house was approximately 230 footsteps away from his home in Oaks. Despite not being his biological son, I was treated as such.

**He Was My Anchor**

<br/>
First, he was my mentor. Always encouraging me to be a better version of myself. The advice he gave throughout the years has stuck with me. I can vividly remember him saying:

> "Petah, always live good mi bwoy, too much wicked people pon earth."

He taught me several things, but in the interest of time here are a few: 

1. He was always a planner. If you catch him mumbling under his breath, rest assured a plan is brewing. He'd often plan for work weeks, or months in advance of tasks he hopes to accomplish. On multiple occasions, I've seen where his level of planning has prevented negative consequences. He taught me at an early age that proper planning prevents poor performance.

2. Dedication & Hard Work. Not only was he a planner, but he gets things done. There is never a day when Bigga would be resting. Even if it meant doing a portion of the work daily. As a young man, I'd disappear for a few days in an attempt to skip the workload. Upon my return, I can vividly remember him saying "Petah yuh a bad bawgin enuh, but cum". That is to indicate his disapproval of me avoiding hard work, yet still, he'd welcome me with open arms. 

3. Resource Management. As with most rural areas, resources such as food and money is scarce. I admired how he often "tun him hand and mek fashion" by finding creative ways to solve problems. Finding creative ways to fund his projects is something his biological children are very much aware of. He taught me how to make the best with what I have.

4. Resting & Proper Nutrition. He loved working, but he love his food and downtime the same. Routinely every Sunday you could hear the One-Drop music thumping through the subwoofer speakers, and the sweet smell of nutritious food coming from the kitchen. Then after 4pm, you can see him reclining on his veranda with the dogs working for their share of the food. Complemented by the rich blend of soursop, passion fruit, sorrel, and guava you're sure to turn up the following Sunday. In this instance, he instill the importance of health, rest and nutrition.
 

5. Always be kind. Once your intentions are pure he will always be ready and willing to help you. He takes pride in helping others and he is happy to share his good deeds with others. People from near, or far, strangers or friends, just ask and Bigga is ready to provide as much support as you need. He taught me that life is about helping others and being kind to the less fortunate.

**His Impact On My Life**

<br/>
Today, I'm a husband and father of an energetic toddler. He has played a significant role in my life today, and without his support, I'd have been a different man today. Let me share a single instance of how he has helped me.

Bigga gave me my first domestic goat. While this may seem simple for most it was significant. That initial investment helped me to go through primary, high school and university. I can vividly remember at least four instances when I was able to purchase books and attend school solely due to his contribution. There were also days when my biological father never had the money to fund my schooling, and Bigga my other father was there to support me. 

I now have an established career, doing my best to support my family and impart some of those principles he taught me. If he wasn't a part of my life, the entire trajectory of my life would have been different. While I do my best to pass on his teachings, I can never repay his kindness and love towards me. 


Because of his support, I was able to stand on his shoulders and reach for the stars. I believe a book called The Go-Giver highlights a principle he has lived by:  

> "Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take".

Thank you, Bigga for everything. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor, friend, and father. I'm what I today because of who he was to me. 
Also I wish to say thanks to his children for sharing your father with me:
-  Cbert : for teaching me how to swim, read clock 
-  Debbie: for teaching me how to do count and other basic mathematics 
-  Ava: for teaching me how to be polite
-  Dennis..
