introduction: Hi, Happy New Year! I know it's the season for making new year resolution, but this time I'm taking a different route. Besides I'm never good at making new year resolution, so I'm focusing on the accomplishments of 2017. As we hope for greater things in 2018, reflecting on the past may create a mental benchmark on future goals. With that said, here is a snapshot of last year.

Hi, Happy New Year! I know it's the season for making new year resolution, but this time I'm taking a different route. Besides I'm never good at making new year resolution, so I'm focusing on the accomplishments of 2017. As we hope for greater things in 2018, reflecting on the past may create a mental benchmark on future goals. With that said, here is a quick snapshot of last year.

**I Jumped The Broom**
!["Jump The Broom"](/images/blog/jump-the-broom.jpg "Jump The Broom")

It was the year of bliss as I jumped the broom. Yes, I married my lover and best friend aka "mi pahri". This is the best decision I've ever made and it has made me the happiest man alive [period]. Joining hands and hearts with the woman who has been standing alongside me through thick and thin is an unexplainable feeling. She is a God-fearing woman who has always been there looking out for my best interest. I'm truly blessed to have found the most beautiful empress to have walked this earth and I'm fully invested in spending the rest of my life appreciating and caring for her in the best way possible.

<br/>
**Being the Best Man for My Friends**

Apparently 2017 was the year when a few of my friends also decided to make a lifetime commitment to their better half. Being the best man was a great experience; it was also an emotional one - no I didn't cry, big man don't cry. To say the least, I'm proud of them and the decision they have made by defying the current stigma and doing what is right. My best wishes and congratulations to you young men!

<br/>
**My Largest Donation Yet**
!["Rock River Donation"](/images/blog/2018-donation.jpg "Rock River Donation")

The mere fact that I'm alive and have the means of providing for my father proves that I'm blessed. Sharing my blessings with others and seeing the joy it brings is a remarkable experience. In 2016 I donated a few computers to my primary school. Last year we took it up a notch buy sponsoring a student and also [donated two computers to a neighbouring school][computer_donation]{:target="_blank"}. Full disclosure, the sponsorship idea came from my wife. She wanted to find a student who will be moving on to a high school and is in need of support. With the help of the current principal (my past teacher) we selected a brilliant student who is the recipient of the most **improved student** for that academic year. Her name is Janice Jackson and on her graduation day, we surprise her with a $20,000 (JMD) scholarship. I remember seeing the suprise on her face upon the realisation that she was the recipient of the award. <br/>
Seeing the progress she has made and her potential, we wanted to provide her with additional assistance and so we became her mentor - also my wife's idea. More on this to come in a future post. We are still figuring out the meaning of mentorship so please bear with us. Despite our lack of knowledge in this area, it is an awesome feeling to help someone achieve their goal. Yeah! <br/>
Brief update: she has just finished her first semester at high school and we are so proud of her. <br/>
_I wish to say thanks to the Hon. Pernel Charles Jr., Minister of State in the Ministry of National Security, for taking time out of his busy schedule to travel all the way to Clarendon and be the guest speaker._

**I'm Helping My Homeless Friend: Bull**

`So early 2016 I met an homeless man who goes by the alias "Bull". He is often close by the Half Way Tree Police Station or next to the plaza infront of the Fire Station. I often pass by him on weekends during my grocery shopping and so I'd purchase extra groceries to share with him. We became friends as I noticed each time I gave him something to eat he'll always say thanks and I found that to be a good thing. His situation had me thinking about why I'm giving offering at church while he is here hungry and homeless. So I decided to use the funds destined for church coffers and purchase food for him instead. I haven't fully perfected this plan however I've tracked my donations as a line item in my budget since November 2016. From that point to now, I've purchased an average of $490 worth of food per month which is a total of $11,050 since then. `

`It pains my heart to see us or government officials misuse funds while the less fortunate suffers. Compound that with the level of inequality and we have yourselves a major issue not being addressed. `

`You may not have $490 per month however when you're buying that weekend KFC or BK think about the less fortunate. A simple gesture won't cost more than $160 (1 bulla = 100 + sml soda $60). Remember they are all our brothers and sisters.`

**House is Fully Off-Grid**
!["Off Grid System"](/images/blog/off-grid.jpg "Off Grid System") 

As they always say, opportunities exist during a crisis. In 2015 a crisis hit home & we lose our connection to JPS due to actions of a neighbour. Fast forward to 2017 where the economic conditions were ideal and I took the opportunity of investing in renewable energy by taking [my house fully off the grid][house_off_grid]. To this date I'm amazed at the idea of gaining power directly from nature and so I started doing a write up to showcase a few benefits. To this date, my small solar system has generated _129.20kWh or about $9,500JMD of electricity since September of 2017_. <br/>
Feel free to read about my journey [here][house_off_grid] and I'm happy to share additional information if required.

**Sharing The "Renewable Dream"**

When you have the "light" why not share the joy? The excitement of using renewable energy propelled me into becoming an "evangelist" for the cause. I started speaking about the benefits of using renewable and then I started selling some of the most reliable flashlights you'll ever own. I'm not a sales person, however I saw a demand for such product especially in the rual areas. [Here is the story of how it all began][hybrid_light]. I also attended the renewable energy expo, held at Pegasus Hotel, and it was a great experience. To top it off I met Emma Lewis (@Petchary) - the well know Jamaican advocate.

**Got My First Pair of Wallabee Clarks**

Clarks is a Jamaican thing and ever since I was in primary school I wanted a pair. [The demand for it increased when Vybz Kartel made a song expressing how good and fashionable the brand is](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/24/clarks-originals-vybz-kartel-reggae). He is doing the same for Foska Oats and Supligen with his current single. But my love for Clarks originated from seeing my neighbour with a pair and that was before Kartel made that famous song Clarks song. In those days we couldn't afford it, so I waited over ten years to own a pair. Wallah! 2017 was the year I owned three pairs of Clarks shoes include the Wallabee - thanks to my wife. I told you she is amazing! They came directly from the manufacture, I even have the history poster, shoe shampoo and brush to prove - I'm serious like a heart attack.

**Purchased My First Linux based Laptop**
!["My Laptop"](/images/blog/linux-laptop.jpg "Linux Laptop")


As an advocate for open source software, I've always wanted to own a pure Linux based machine ie. a machine built for Linux. That desire came through when I bought my [System76, Lemur][system_76_laptop]{:target="_blank"}, which comes with Linux installed. Fun fact: even the super key has the Ubuntu logo on it. This is not only an important symbolic gesture but putting my $ behind a brand which supports the Linux ecosystem is a great step in the right direction. A technical review of this machine is coming soon.

**5K Walk-Run - Food For the Poor**
!["The 5K Walk-Run"](/images/blog/5k-walk-run.png "The 5K Walk-Run")

Helping others by adding value to their lives is an important belief I hold dearly. I had the opportunity to do exactly that while having some fun at the [Food for the Poor 5k walk/run][food_for_the_poor]{:target="_blank"}. The proceeds of this fundraising event were used in the building of homes for the less fortunate. Based on report in the [Jamaican Observer][homes_report]{:target="_blank"} they were able to build 40 homes as of May 2017. <br/>
Guess what! All the homes will contain a small solar system which has the ability of running lights and charging small devices. Once again sharing the renewable dream.

<br/>
**Enjoying Our History & Culture**

I love our country: the beautiful landscape, people, music and food. Even the way we give a huge round of applause each time a flight touch down at any of our major airport. For historical reasons, I started collecting Jamaican plays. I realised that it is one of the most powerful forms of cultural expression, it is odd why there isn't an official Jamaican movie night. Here is the list of plays/documentaries I've watched: Akwantu, Queen Nanny, Living Dangerously. 
I'm working hard to get/buy/beg/cry for a copy of Bashment Granny, Destiny and God's Way, I do hope my pursuit will be a success in 2018.


Despite 2017 being an amazing year there were a few challenges. Why focus on the delta when I have life and once there is life there is hope. I thank God for all he has done and I want to wish you all a great and blessed 2018. I'll close off by repeating my favourite quote:

> Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life - Tecumseh.
