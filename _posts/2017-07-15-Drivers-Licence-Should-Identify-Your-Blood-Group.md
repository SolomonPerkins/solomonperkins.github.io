introduction: Less than a year ago I got my license and it is by no stretch an achievement for me. I've been driving cattle from an early age so driving a machine is not such a huge challenge. The possibility of being mowed down by the un-predictable cattle is slim when compared to driving on our roads. In all seriousness, based on the rate of increase in road accidents, I believe we should have our blood group (aka blood type) clearly visible on our driver's license. Let us discuss how this could help in saving a life in the event of a life-threatening road accident.

Less than a year ago I got my license and it is by no stretch an achievement for me. In the country side, I've been driving cattle from an early age so driving a machine is not such a huge challenge. The possibility of being mowed down by the unpredictable cattle is slim when compared to driving on our roads. In all seriousness, based on the increase in road fatilities, I believe the driver's licence should have the owner's blood group (aka blood type) clearly written.

**No accident (no pun) why we have so many Accidents**

!["Road Safety Unity Statistics"](/images/blog/road-accidents-stats.jpg "The Road Safety Unit Stats. on Accidents")
According to data form the [Road Safety Unity in Jamaica, an average of 3,654 people died on our roads between 2005-2015](https://twitter.com/RoadSafetyJA/status/812347864886235136){:target="_blank"}. Last year (2016) report showed that 377 people were killed and they are expecting a 15% (321 deaths) this year - [Jamaica Gleaner](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20170104/road-fatalities-decline-2016-safety-unit-projects-further-decrease){:target="_blank"}. I'm not an expert, but I believe that there are multiple factors contributing to this high number:

1. Road users (passengers,drivers & cyclists) aren't wearing the safety gears.
2. Drivers aren't obeying the speed limit and [pedestrians are being affected](https://twitter.com/RoadSafetyJA/status/863428949564674048){:target="_blank"}. 
3. [The inceasing number of vechiles on the roads.](https://twitter.com/RoadSafetyJA/status/874267540507082752){:target="_blank"}
4. Drivers aren't practicing defensive driving.
5. DUI (Driving Under the Influence) of...

Combining these factors provides some insight as to why there are so many accidents on our roads.

**The Benefit**
<br/>
<br/>
Your blood group is very important and you should know yours - I'm serious guys. This classification should directly impact your diet and lifestyle. Having it on the driver's license will provide faster access to that information in a situation where time is of the essence. Take for example: in the event of a serious accident and the victim(s) are in need of immedicate blood transfer; Having the information readily available is much faster. I do acknowledge that the blood test takes less than 10 minutes, however life is precious and every second counts. I do understand that this idea may not be a priority for the Road Safety Unity or the Ministry of Health. This is a low hanging fruit and it is one which may assist in imporving the system and may ultimately save a life.

Lastly, please be careful on the roads and remember to drive with caution. [Here are a few safety videos to help you ride & drive good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sny1gj_bsI&index=2&list=PL9lu38d90KtFTO7Thf86J6JsscnNZkljN){:target="_blank"}
