**A Flashlight made my day**

Awesome, the flashlights are here!!! No I'm not crazy (well not that much), but happiness knows no boundaries and I'm truely happy after I got the lights I've been waiting on for a couple weeks.

**Explaining it's value**

So before that thought of me being crazy, ferments in your head, let me explain my excitment and please listen with an open mind. Yes, it looks like a flashlight, has the features of a flashlight and yes it is a flashlight.

But, you've never seen a flashlight light this before.
> It its renewable ie. runs of solar-powered rechargable batteries
> It is water resistant, drop resistant and extremly durable.
> Power usage at about 6hrs and holds charge for about 10 years.

By extension, this is a product created by an American company called [Hybridlight](http://hybridlight.com/about-us/) owned and operated by some folks who seems obsessed with outdoors, renewable energy, and gadgets. The first time I saw the flashlight, it was blown away instantly by its practicality and robustness. I'll spear you my on intial reations to the product, but in short I knew I wanted one instantly. 

**Why You Need it?**
Apart form the warnings sent by the MET office during the hurrican seasons; advicing families to stock up on tin foods, water, batteries, flashlight etc, most folks don't have a need for a flashlight.
But I see this as must have for folks living in rural areas, especially farmers.

First reason, JPS: We all know how it is when JPS has a powercut, Mhm. During regular weather conditions, rural area often have their power reinstated no more than a day after it goes out. However, in the urban area - "Dog nawm yuh suppah" - as power goes out for days. This affects people's livelyhood in so many ways. I remember we lost power for about two weeks and saw my neighbour cooking all the unfrozen chickens, lol serious fun times.

Farmers are my second reason: They always say that a farmer's job is never done. Correct, as even in the night they'll have to tend to their cattles or crops during an emergency. I remember my daddy halling me out of bed to go to go and check on the goats - yea fun times for sure. Moments like these, the little bannger phone can't provide enough lighting to see in the dark.

**Why I Need It?**
I went through all that trouble not because I am am huge fan of solar, but because my dad would find this tool very useful, now let me explain why I love and need this product. My dad likes to visit the shop at night to play dominoes and lime with his friends. The road he takes doesn't have proper lighting and as such he resorts to the banger phone to see while travelling. Of all the years I've been there I hadden thought about this problem until I started working in the city. Just the mere thought of him travelling on that dark road without proper lighting scares me. So I need it because it will be my gift to him.

**How I Got Buzz on this Product**
I first saw this product in early December 2016, when I visited [Solar Buzz]() to view their well advertised solar-home package. Eventhough their business model doesn't cater to "small fries", like myself, I saw the flashlight and dammmnnn! I wanted it. I offer to purchase a few but I got the run-around, yes you guessed it I was a "small fry" (not a retailer). December passed and my dad didn't get any thank you gift, so I went to a few retailers who had purchased the product from Solar Buzz. Low an behold, one of the retailers added over 200% markup on the item, resulting in a huge jump from $3,500 at Solar Buzz to $7,500 at location Y. 

I was actually hurt by that slavery-price tag, I went to work and complained to my co-wokers who listened diligently throught this ordeal - thanks for listening guys. So like true champ, I went online and source it on amazon for less than 10USD each (JMD $1,280). Today I picked them up, with all smiles.

**For A Worthy Cause**
Gifts which originates from the heart, will have great value to the both parties as it often creates a sense of fulfillment. As it relates to my father, I will go the extra mile in ensuring that he is comfortable and I firmly believe that this gift will help in doing just that.
So I would like to say thanks to: 
> Solar Buzz for the exposure 
> HybridLight for "giving me the power of the sun in the palm of my hands"
> Amazon and other companies 
> my cowokers for listening while I rant.
