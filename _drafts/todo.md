The Delicate Balance of Life
============================


Performance Testing - Scaling our Online Services √
===========================================
	- Objective:
		- While we transform our society to become more tech savvy, we should focus on the capacity of these systems.
		- Great emphasis should be placed on the critical services such as: Tax, bill payment systems, pension management systems, health and other essential govenment services.
	
	- What is Performance Testing:
		- Similar to food industry the food inspector validates the rediness of the food for human consumption. So it performance testing to applications.
		- Figuring out the capacity of the system is called performance testing.
		- Having true visiblity in your system becomes evermore relevant based on the importance of the infrastructure.
		- It is a technique/practice used to understand: how many/where may break your system.
		- The end result is a report.


    - What Prompted This Article:
    	- Jamaica Champs2018 and the # of folks complaining about the poor performance of TVJ online stream service (https://twitter.com/nigeeeeeeee/status/977724814801555456).
    	- During the streaming they also notified of technical difficulties (https://twitter.com/garveygirl/status/977767402803990528) and (https://twitter.com/ricksocool/status/977863268575449090).
    	- Throught this article will use this incident as point of reference to acknowledge the relevance of capacity planning. Also assumptions and evaluations done are based on my assumptions.
    
    - What If..
    	- Champs is just a couple days event and majority of the viewers watch it via TV
    	- Escalate this issue at a government service level.
    	- What if it happened when majority of the citizens decides to utilize a public service at any given time?
    		- Case in point: all dilenquent traffic offenders decides to pay their finds online at the final minute.
    	- If you think these situations won't happen, consider these incidents:
    		- Affordable Care Act (Obama Care Roll out)
    		- ...


    - The Relevance:
    	- As the population increases & the economy continues to grow the pop. will gravitate to online services.
    	- Trust, Confidence and availability are important NFRs consumers value dearly.
    	- Consumers are being exposed to online services. They expect the same standard at home.
    
    - Mitigation Strategies:
    	- Integrating performance testing as a requirement for all essential IT contracts. 
    	- This could be included as a checklist to be carried out in the final phase of a project.
    	- Revsion and system check should be done based on key population data eg. population increases.
    	

    "When trouble a come shell nuh blow", let us heed that warning from my grandmother and anticipate these pitfalls expereinced by companies/government worldwide.

		- In [this grid post] I explained how and why I did it.
		-  

	- Sharing The "Renewable Dream"

My House is Off-Grid (DIY Project) √
=====================
	- How it all started
		- In life there are always push factors.
		- 
	- Why I Choose Off-Grid
		- Decentralize electricity
		- ROI seemed feasible.
		- We don't have stable power in the country area.
		- Regular increase in electricty bill.
		- Companies are subsidising their electricity bill.
		- No tax on renewable energy products.
		- It is right for the environment.
	- The Journey Began.
		- Research about the technology.
		- Find people with similar passion.
			- Kimroy Bailey, Co-Worker Andrew Hall
		- Have dialog and conversation with co-workers.
		- Become facinated with the technology: Travelling and looking for setups.
		- Did a twitter moments on the few I know about.
	-  Market Research & Resource Allocation:
		- Doing market research was a roller coaster ride. 
		- Went to a couple dealers, most was for the high-end customers.
		- To my liking found: CyberMedia, GetSol, FosRich, Pegasus Traders and Kimroy Bailey.
		- Resource allocation took a year to complete.
	-  Design/Installation
		- After watching 100s of videos on youtube, reading countless experts it was time to design my very own system.
		- Design consideration: flexibility, scalability, extend current infrastructure. 
		- All things considered I ended up designing the system to accommodate to run the following:
			- A refridgerator, LCD TV, Radio, ~4 light
		- For implementation, finding an electrical expert wasn't difficulty. One of my best friends: Kenel Douglas - electrician lived close by.
		- Installation was done in a phase by phase basis started on Saturday September 9, 2017 and ended the following Sunday.
		- Essentially installation involves: setup equiptment, wiring and pv panel installation (in that order).
		- 
	- Reactions
		- I did this all for my dad and boy-was he happy. For each item I turned on all we could here was my dad saying "thanks man many thanks", weather it was the Tv, lights, radio or the refridgerator.
		- For me I was impressed as I finally completed this project after all our hardwork we finally did it - Thank God!
	- System Caveats:
		- As you know solar system runs off the sun and so if you don't have any sunshine then you know what that means. System was designed to sustain 1night and 4hours without sun.
		- High energy consumption activies such as ironing, must be done in the day time.
		- 
		


God Code!

Shuttleworth Pulling Down The Unity Shutters
============================================
	- http://www.zdnet.com/article/mark-shuttleworth-considering-canonical-ipo/
	- Ubuntu is a public company
	- They got distracted by pushing to mobile, Ubuntu TV and IoTs: running down the latest
	- They moved away from the desktop without capturing the market fully.
	- The move to Gnome may have a good and bad impact:
		- New Ubuntu users only knows Unity
		- There seems to be the need to look more attractive to investors

Driver's Licence should have your blood group √
============================================
[Reference](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003345.htm)
 	- Introduction
 		- Less than a year ago I got my license and it is by no stretch an achievement for me.
 		I've been driving cows and goats from an early age so driving a machine is not such a huge challenge.
 		- In all seriousness I believe we should have our blood group on the driver's license as it could help to save the lives in case of a life-threatening accident.

 	- It is no accident why we have so many Accidents
 		- "Increase in accidents" Based on statistics form the [transport authority]('FIND LINK'), there has been a constant increase in the number of accidents on our roads.
 		- More vechile are on the road and the road surface area in towns and cities remain constant. - just increase the chance
 		- Most are being taught hit the throttle fast and brake late, but not to handle the vechile during difficult situations.
 		- Most aren't obeying the speed limits. Even in areas where this is most important, schools, hospitals etc. It is sad to know that so many lives are being lost
 		- Yes the culture, fast driving is cool and if you are a slow driver you are a sissy!
 		- DUI.. of substances which will affect your ability to manage the vehile is also annother issue

 		Combining these factors provides a clear reason as to why there are so many accidents on our roads.

 	- Saves Time
 		- Your blood group is very important and you should know yours - I'm serious guys.
 		- Having it on the driver's license will provide faster access to that information in a situation where time is of the essence.
 		- In the event of a critical accident which requires time is of the essence blood type by just viewing their license takes less time when compared to doing a blood test [ABO test](Find LINK)
 		- In case of a serious accident having all the information up from could help to save a life.
 		- Outside of that it may help you to remember/know your blood type so you may help others in time of need.

 	- 
 	I do understand that this idea may not be a priority at the moment but is the little things that will make the system works better. The roads are becoming ever more dangerious, even the dogs & mangooses are taking note so let us do our part to

 	

Graduates, Your Resume Needs Validation √
================================
	- Introduction
		- You're ready for the working world and the traditional questions kicks in, similar to a question asked by Gerby 
		- It all started with this tweet: 
			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A part of the difficulty in landing a job in Ja is crafting an effective cover letter and CV that say exactly what they want</p>&mdash; Gerbs (@GerbryJA) <a href="https://twitter.com/GerbryJA/status/845407481924866050">March 24, 2017</a></blockquote>
			<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		- Speaking about how the job market has changed and a new level of thinking is required to stay ahead.

	- The Traditional Approach
		- Traditionally the first rule is to A's all your courses.
		- Having A's equates to the fact that you're good at remembering things, doesn't necessarliry translates to Knowledge level or practical competence.
		- Next is to create an resume & cv that is perfect and hit a home run.
		- Perform the infront of the class repeating who am I, what I represent and what I can bring to the table.
		- Then you turn up for the interview and hope that your Aced resume will land you that first gig.

	- The Problem With That
		- No doubt that the traditional approch has been working.
		- I don't think it helps you to stand out.
		- It fails to translate your capabilities.
		- It is difficult to express your self on 1-2 pages.
		- And no one looks at the CV letter, at least I didn't.
		- Essential we are doing an old routine that is outdated.
		- It is difficult to showcase your skills to the interviewee.
		- The most intellecutual speaker showing the right personality gets hired.

	- My Advice
		- My suggestions are not based on scientific data, they are based on my personal experience.
		- Seek a summer job in your field, volunteer if you have to 
		- Doing one or two side projects linked to your area of study.
		- Course work done are more valuable than you think. 
		- Read about your specialisation and understand the best practices
		- Combine all the above into an archive/portfolio/blog.
		- Create that resume and CV.
		- Seek feedback on your resume from the relevant groups in your school.
		- Iterate on the resume until it is perfect.
		- During your next interview bring that portfolio & resume and present both to your interviewer(s) and see which they are more excited to see.

	- #AlternativeFacts or Legitimate Advice?
		- I believe in proving the concept before sharing its worth.
		- The advice shared above is excalty what got me my gig at the company I'm currently employed at.
		- I went in that interview with a working prototype, portfolio & a resume.
		- 90% of the interview was spent discussing my prototype & portfolio.
		- The remaining 10% was done resume and working environment, which were just a matter of formality.
		- Yes, my advice worked for me and tweaking it should work for you.

		- When compared to the traditional approach, this approach lives up to the mantra "action speaks louder than words"
		- Showing your skills essentially allows the interviewer to validate your skills and then connect the dots by info. on your resume.
		
	- Job Recruitment Qualifications? N/A
		- I'm merely sharing what worked for me and I have not professional certificate to validate.
		- I however once volunteered for one of our recruitment drive where I offered my assistance with a few interviews.
		- Yes we did that 90% : 10% as well.

	- My Final Thoughts
		- The traditional approach will not suffice.
		- Interviewers often have to interview alot of individuals, the key is to prove that you are worth it by showing off your skills.
		- Your resume doesn't truely reflect your true potential

	Awesome, the flashlights are here!!! No I'm not crazy (well not that much), but happyness knows no boundary and I'm truely happy after I finally got have them after months of waiting.
	

	- Explaining it's value
	 

	- Why You Need it?

	- Why I Need It?
		I went through all that trouble not because I am am huge fan of solar, but because my dad would find this tool very useful, now let me explain. He doesn't likes to visit the shop at night to play dominoes and lime with his friends. The road he takes doesn't have proper lighting and as such he resorts to the banger. Of all the years I've been there I haden thought about this problem until I started working in town. The idea of him travelling that dark road without proper lighting scares me. So I need it because it will be my gift to him.

	- How I Got Buzzed
		I first saw this product in early December 2016, when I visited [Solar Buzz]() to view the products that they had to offer. Eventhough their business model doesn't cater to small fries, like myself, I saw the flashlight and damm I wanted it. L

Books I've Read in 2015-2016
====================================
![Books Read Photo](/images/blog/books-read-2015-2016.jpg)
	- Introduction
		- They might not be much.
		- I'm not trying to compete with the great book lovers of our time: locally (Gordon Swaby). Internationally: Zuckerberg, Richard Brandson
		- A huge quest for knowledge and the desire to change my persepctives drove my curiosity are the common themes you'll notice.
		- In college reading was not a hobby, the exception was for Linux and open source technology.
		- After I finished college I was more entrenced in technology without the desire of connecting the knowledge to the real world.
	
	- Running Lean - Ash Maurya
	![Running Lean](/images/blog/running-lean-book.jpeg)
		- How I manage to own a copy 
			- This book was introduced to me by Medullan, the IT firm I've spent the past 4 years owning and growing in my craft.
		- What is the Book about
			- Build, Measure, Learn are the three main concepts it emphasises.
			- It focuses on optimizing the SDLC by creating a new approach in how business models are structure.
			- It puts the customer at the front of the cycle, and ensure they (customer) drives the product
			- The new disruptive strategy deviates from the traditional approach of spending months identifying business feasibility far away form the customer and then give them an unwanted product at the end.
			- Doing away with a twenty page business, they encournage a one page business plan called the canvas. 
			- This then transforms who presentation or product pitch is done - hitting the main points for that 5 minutes pitch.
		- Its impact on my life
			- Rewire my brain, allowed me to think and connect this new approach affects our modus operandi.
			- Creates more managable and scalable cycle. Just like Agile software development it breaks down the improtant and integral flow.
			- If you are a young entreprenure and want/hoping to start your business in the future, this is the best model to iterate on. Learn from Ash Maurya pain, and follow his book to the "T" and I'm sure you'll see the unbiased benefits being offered.
	
	- Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiosaki
		![The Rich Dad Cover](/images/blog/rich-dad-poor-dad-book.jpeg)

		- My Ears Got Me In Trouble
			- At work and a few co-workers were talking stuff they enjoyed. This book was then mentioned.
			- Being inquisitive, I instantly jumped right in the middle of the conversation asking more details.

		- This Book Will Make You Rich - Rich With Knowledge
			- First and foremost, this book is amazing. Knowledge is definitely power.
			- It teaches financial knowledge, the knowledge school fail to teach.
			- The main theme is about getting out of the rat race, a journey not taken by the 99%.
			- It explorse the patterns of life, and how we are wrong we are. It depicts a story of a boy having two dads a rich (not formally educated) and and a poor dad (formally educated).
			- The approach taught by the book may be summed up with this quote: "Work to learn. Don't work for money... Look for jobs that can help you develop the skills, systems and people rather than just pay you well".
		- Dammnn This Book is Powerful!
			- I'm always interested in knowing the route not taken by the majority. This book is perfect.
			- The lessons thought are still governing my life. Even my evaluations of wants and needs are being put into question. 
			- It's impact is so far reaching, I often sit and question our priorities and truly distinguishing needs from wants.
			- Even propelled me into tweeting about questions like these: [](/images/blog/rich-dad-poor-dad-inspired-tweet).
			- That knowledged learned form reading this book is unquantifiable and for that I'm forever grateful.
			- I advice, young recruits, college students or anyone who wants to open their perspective on how our society is structured.
			- This book is definitely future and generation proof.


	- How to Make Money With Stocks
		- "Rich Dad Poor Dad" -> Now This
			- After getting some new knowledge from reading Rich Dad Poor Dad I was so interested in learning about how these different equipty market works.
			- I searched for this one.
			- It was as if college had failed to educated me of proper spending habits or how I these other entities work.
			- Admittedly I didn't went to college for this, so I guess they told us stuff on a need to know basis. I think it however accomplishes one goal: increase my curiosity about the world.
		- What is This Stocks Thingy About?
			- So you've heard about stocks, bonds and all forms of so called "iniquity" - cough I mean equipty.
			- But actually this book provides an insight into how you should prepare for the future.
			- Noticed how the simple 9-5 can't cover for basic expenses, and how it can't stretch to fit your life.
			- This is how it has always been, and for a comfortable life, one should have a more serious discussion on these matters. This book helps to form those ideal questions and help guide your thoughts.
			- I had no clue, except for the definition, as to what stocks and bonds are about.
			- I wanted to know how wealth maybe gained, or how I may go about chanting my own course in life.
			- This doesn't mean I am pursuing this path head on, but knowledge can NEVER be enough.
			- I highly recommend this book, only after you've had your brain re-wired by "Rich Dad Poor Dad".

	- New Testment Version of The Bible
		![The Bible](/images/blog/the-bible-book.jpeg)

		- A Treasure Trove of knowledge
			- I won't get to bliblical here, so I hope you stick through this with me.
			- I read the New Testment because I wanted to learn more, become more humble and understand some hidden secrets to life.
			- There was no other way to find one book that governs humans activity, the advices shared in has helped to guide my life.
		- It Teaches Simple Lessons 
			- We often get caught up in doing multiple things, we often forget that simplicity is key.
			- So I ready a newer version of the bible called "The Message", it simplifies some of the complex terms such as: "Wence", "Thou" and "Thine" to a language I can understand, english - No I can't read that patois/creole bible. "Yeah me chat patois but nuh tell me fi read it rasta".
			- Moving on, It teaches how simple things affects our lives, and how we should be living.
			- Alot of those insperational quotes, are often times linked to bible scriptures. 
			- It also teaches you how to care for your family, enemies and on a wider scale, your fellow neighbours.
			- I agree that some sections are a bit confusing, but the Bible even provide the key to unlock these complex sections - pray and read slowly with an open mind.
		- The Everlasting Impact
			- Providing powerful yet some great advice. 
			- Having issues with your personal life, health, mental state, crisis? This section has a solution for you. 
			- I often quickly load up the app to get a quick daily quote, and suprisingly the information are linked to my situation.
			- I'll employer anyone to read this book wether you are: egotistic, Mr/Mrs know-it-all, Mr. omnipotent, or even superman himself - as we all have our kryptonite.
			- I sincerely recommend anyone to read this book, and in a couple months and you'll see how those simple scriptures impacts your life, especially the ones in Proverbs.

	- The Healing Wonders of Herbs - H. G. Ladion
		![The Healing Wonders of Herbs - H. G. Ladion](/images/the-healing-wonders-of-herbs-book.jpeg)

		- The Bush Cure
			- So let us stripe the capitalist and mas-marketing culture aside for a few and talk about a book that I've read.
			- I was curious of finding out how I could learn about all these amazing plants and how they maybe used to cure various illnesses.
			- So my grandmother was a wizard at this knowledge, but after she passed away I felt empty as I had no clue what most of these hers do - except for ciruse, peppermint, alovera, tuna and tabrine tree.
			- While liming with a few co-workers and expressing my loss of knowledge about mother nature, one mentioned he has a book about herbs.
			- Basically you know what happens next, I beg until he loaned it to me: which reminds me I need to return it. 
		- All About Cure
			- Yep, it contains a treasure trove of cures for various types of ailment.
