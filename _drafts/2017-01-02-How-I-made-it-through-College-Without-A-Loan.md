Hi All, Happy New Year and I wish for you and your families all the joys and success this year has to offer.

This is my second blog post and I wish to share my experience on how I made it through University without a Load. It is often said that Education is the key, rightly so. As the opportuniteis which it affords you,your family and country are tremendous and we should make the effort to grasping it with both hands. As [Person said] [Find a Jamaica quote on Teritary Education] Teritary education is an integral to the country's development. Persuing Teritary Education should be supported by reseach in field of preference + current & future job markets & demand for skills [Link supporting this data].


So now that I am through with the ground work it is time for the "meat of the matter", let us begin to outline the sequence of events & my thought processes in a shortened version. If you wish to not read my shortened version, here is is a summary:
1. Benefit from the National Youth Service Program (20% of tuition for 3 years)
2. Benefited from the JAMVAT Program (30% of tuition)
3. Scholarship programs 
4. Family support

Please not, this is by no-means me being boastful, I am merely showing proof that there are alternative & more cost effective ways of funding your teritary education without the use of loan programs in Jamaica. So I humble apologise to anyone who may view this content differently.


**Family Background**

So let me provide some background before you start assuming that my parent(s) is/are wealthy or they started saving beforehand in preparation for Teritary education. None of the above, not even close. I grew up in the cool cool hills of Clarendon in a single parent home. My dad played the role of both parents (true hero). He is a small scale farmer: rearing cattle and cultivating small crops was our main form of food. Am essentially saying we survived on less than $500/day (validate by calculating the cost of food at that time). Essentially we had to struggle to make ends meet even though it was only two of us.


**Final Years of High School**

In my fourth year of Clarendon College High School, at this time I was almost through the gate and I started thinking about University and my career path. By this time I had realized that my only option was to make the best of my remaining time. Knowing that I had no money to fund my teritary education and as such I started research programs which provides scholarship. While doing my summer job through the National Youth Service I learnt of their education 20% program. At this time I also heard about: JNCB scolarship program, Clarendon College Scholarship Program (your high school may offer one), VMBS Scholarship programs, and the popular SLB. 

Fast forward to the end of sixth form, reality had set in, all my friends were matritriculating into either UWI, NCU ect. At this point I had gotten through to UWI and the SLB was the only option I had steering me in the face. I wanted to know the pros and cons of using this loan program, here was what I found:
1. Two guarentors were required (Major problem for me)
2. The interest rate was 12% per annum starting from the day you signed the agreement.
3. I had no guarented job, after I complete my studies.

After compunding those findings with a few calculation I realised that I will be spending the next 10-20 years, paying back a loan. In [2006](Validate and Identify the status of the economy) were were in difficult enconomic conditions. Living on ~$500/day, I could not justify borrowing ~$1.9million and my repayment plan.

**Finding the Alternative**

So I turned down the SLB option, and differed my university acceptance letter. I truly believe that the SLB cannot be the only way I my fund my education as the son of a poor man. The sad feeling swept over me as the friends I had known for 6 years are now going on to university and I am left behind. So by this time I was determined to make it even if that means delaying my education for a year. I truley believed that there was another way of getting higher education with signing away my little freedom. All those financial-aid programs I had known about I went and apply to a few of them. In [2007](Need to validate) was enrolled in the NYS program for 6 months (Thank you Lord). Upon successful completetion, this is a guaranted 20% for 3 years. Now motivated that I can still realize my dream, I then applyed for a HEART program called [School Leavers Training Opportuninty Programme (SL-TOP)](https://www.facebook.com/HEARTTrustNTA/posts/10151039703326962). Even though they are geared towards transforming graduates into the job market, I utilized the opporutinity to learn and grow from experts and gained invaluable insights into the working world.

The other pogram which made my dark path lit up and increase the possiblity of futhuring my studies was the [JAMVAT program](Link to the JAMVAT). They will offer up to 30% of your tuition on a yearly basis provided that you are qualified. This option only requires 1000hours of voluntary service. 

By this time I had a guaranted 20% from NYS, and an assume ungauranteed 30% from JAMVAT in total will be 50% of my goal. I then now realised that I need to go get help from my family members. So I humbly went to my uncles and aunts seeking support for the remaining capital. One agreed to provide me with the support I so badly needed. There you have it, 100% funding with God, hard work and time.

**College Life and the Realities**
A little side note: attending UTECH felt like I was in a foreign land; very expensive, but it is worth it.

By a few weeks in my first semester, my prayers were answered: I was selected for the JAMVAT scholarship program. I felt extatic then I stepped in to learning and investigation mode. I then had to figure out how I may fund my daily expenses. Beyond just setting up a budget I had to find was of saving and earning money. I found ways of gaining small income, reduce expense. Reducing expenses were extreme, as I'd use the books from the library insted of making a purchase.
