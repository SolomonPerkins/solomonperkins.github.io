Hi All, Happy New Year and I wish for you and your family all the best wishes.

This is my second blog post and I wish use this opportunity to share my experience as to how I made it through university without any form of loan/debt. It is often said that Education is the key, rightly so. But the main issue facing most families is the high cost of teritary education. Multiple researches, including the the XXXXX article is[Find Research confirming the major reason for not attending teritary education][], have confirmed that the high cost is one of the major factor preventing enrollment or successful completion. On the brighter side, the opportuniteis which it affords you or your family are tremendous and we should make every the effort to grasping it with both hands. As [Person said] [Find a Jamaica quote on Teritary Education] Teritary education is an integral part of the country's development and the government have put measures in place in an effort to increase it's affordability - [CAPRI Research 2007](http://www.capricaribbean.com/sites/default/files/public/documents/briefing_paper/funding_tertiary_education_in_jamaica.pdf). In addition to the opportunites of achieving that goal exists and I encourage individuals to capitalise on some of the resources available. The governement is not the only institution offering assistance, there are other non-profit organsiations and private sector entities who are giving a helping hand. ALAS, I found a treasure trove of related information at [J-TEC](http://jtec.gov.jm/scholarships - this brings me to my first lesson/key point, the information exists, the onus is on your to find it. 

[According to Gleaner, the government pays approximately 80% of your tuition ](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100816/lead/lead2.html)


If you wish to not read the entire epistle, here is a quick summary highlighting how I achieve my goal debt free:
1. Benefitted from the National Youth Service Program (20% of tuition for 3 years)
2. Benefitted from the JAMVAT Program (30% of tuition)
3. Recieved Scholarship programs.
4. Recieved support from family members.

Please note that this is not me bragging about my success. I am merely showing proof that there are alternative & more cost effective ways of funding your teritary education without the use of loan programs. So I humble apologise to anyone who may view this content differently.


**Family Background**

So let me provide some background before you start assuming that my parent(s) is/are wealthy or they started saving beforehand in preparation for Teritary education. None of the above, not even close. I grew up in the cool cool hills of Clarendon in a single parent home. My dad played the role of both parents (true hero). He is a small scale farmer: rearing cattle and cultivating small crops was our main form of food. Am essentially saying we survived on less than ~$300JMD per day. Essentially we had to struggle to make ends meet even though it was a single parent household.


**Final Years of High School**

Jump to my fourth year at Clarendon College High School, at this time I was almost through the gates and I started thinking seriously about university and my career path. By this time I had realized that my only option was to make the best of my remaining years. Knowing that I had no money to fund my teritary education, I started to research ways of funding this venture. While doing my summer job at Chapelton Public Hospital, through the National Youth Service (NYS) summer program, I learnt of the NYS 20% education program. At this time I also heard about: JNCB scolarship program, Clarendon College Scholarship Program (your high school may offer one), VMBS Scholarship programs, and the popular Student Loan Bureau (SLB). 

Fast forward to the end of sixth form, reality had set in, all my friends were ready to matritriculate into either UWI, NCU, Knox, Cuba University. At this point I had gotten through to UWI and the SLB was the only option I had steering me in the face. I wanted to know the pros and cons of using this loan program so I did some research and here were some of the findings:
1. Two guarentors were required (Major problem for me)
2. The interest rate was [12%](http://www.slbja.com/annualreports/SLB-Annual-Report-2011-2012.pdf) per annum starting from the day you signed the agreement.
3. I had no guarented job, after my studies.

Side note: Since then SLB has made signification improvements, ranging from reducing interest rates to 9% and [**payments on the reducing balance**](https://www.slbja.com/news.detail.aspx?DetailID=85).

Ok back to my story, after compunding those findings with a few calculations I realised that I will be spending the next 10-20 years, paying back a huge dept. In [2006-2007](http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/economics-statistics/annual-economic-review/annual-economic-review-2006/jamaica/AER2006_Jamaica.pdf) the enconomy was reviving but in my neck of the woods, revival was absent. Also living on ~$300 per day, I could not mentally justify borrowing ~$1.9million without having a solid plan as to how I might repay that debt. That lead to also think about the reprucussions which may arose if I choose the wrong career path.

**Finding the Alternatives**

So I turned down the SLB option, and [defferal](http://www.utechjamaica.edu.jm/admissions/enrolment) my university educaiton for a year. I truly believe that the SLB cannot be the only option available to fund my education. My decision was a lonely one, as my "mojo" got dewildered as the sad feeling swept over me as the friends I had known for 6 years were moving on to university and I was left behind. But I was stiff-headed, yet I forced myself in accepting the facts and look forward to greater things. I truly believed that there were another ways of getting higher education without signing away my little freedom given to by our national heroes (The bible also advice agains debt - [Proverbs 22:7](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-7.htm)).

Time for action, so I went and apply to a few of financial-aid programs I had done research on. In 2007 was enrolled in the NYS program for 6 months (Thank you Lord). Upon successful completetion, this is a guaranted 20% for 3 years, howraay! (FIX) Now motivated that I can still realize my dream, I then applyed for a HEART program called [School Leavers Training Opportuninty Programme (SL-TOP)](https://www.facebook.com/HEARTTrustNTA/posts/10151039703326962). Even though they are geared towards transforming graduates into the job market, I utilized the opporutinity to learn and grow from experts and gained invaluable insights into the working world.

The other pogram which made my path brighter and increased the possiblity of futhuring my studies was the [JAMVAT program](http://scholarshipjamaica.com/jamvat-scholarship/). This program offers up to 30% of your tuition on a yearly basis provided that you are qualified. This option only requires 1000hours of voluntary service at any given institution. 

By this time I had a guaranted 20% from NYS, and an assume ungauranteed 30% from JAMVAT in total will be 50% of my goal. I then now realised that I need to go get help from my family members. So I humbly went to my uncles and aunts seeking support for the remaining capital. One agreed to provide me with the support I so badly needed. There you have it, 100% funding with God, hard work and time.

**College Life and the Realities**
A little side note: attending UTECH felt like I was in a foreign land: very expensive, but my visit was for a worthy cause.

By a few weeks in my first semester, my prayers were answered, I was selected for the JAMVAT scholarship program. Now I was able to fund 50% of my tuition cost at least for a year. My celebration was short lived as I then had to figure out how I may fund my daily expenses. This was the time I proved Mr Kyiasoki's theory, if you need it your mind will find a way to achieve it. Beyond just setting up a budget I had to find ways and means of saving and earning. The money I had saved while doing the SL-TOPs & NYS came to my rescue on multiple occassions, and for that I can't stress enough the importance of saving for a rainy day. 

As the years progressed, so is the level of difficulty. The environment became a true stress test of one's potential - my grandmother use to say "Yuh wah good, yuh nose haffi run". By the end of my third year I was faced with another challenge. The NYS program only lasted for three years and my main support is about to expire. No, I didn't know what was my next move. However it so happened that I my obsession with computers and my field of study landed me a scholarship. This is the next major lesson: Following what you believe in and it will yield results. 

**Spend Drifting To The End**
Now I am at the end of my four years at UTECH and every money spent up to this point, had to be a necessity. During Graduation ($17,000 + $2,500 photo shoot) wasn't considered a necessity as I saw that it as a last ditced effort by the institution to capitalise on a celebration. Instead, I purchased a well needed pair of shoes then I travelled home & celebrated with my father. (Ending in an unpleasant note.. Adjust)

**Lessons Learnt**
And that is how I made it through four years of university without using the SLB program. 
Here are some of the lessons learnt:

1. Hard work and dedication are the secrets used in unlocking life's hidden treasures.
2. Whatever the mind can concieve you can surely achieve it.
3. Despite the high cost of teritary education, we are blessed for a couple of reasons: 1. It has been heavily subsidized by the Jamaican Government. 2. There are multiple NGOs, scholarships, grants available to help you on your journey.
4. Often times the first/easier options aren't the best choice. Alternative paths do exists, you just have to find them.
5. Never let your past decides your future, only let it be a lesson.
6. Your mind is a powerful tool, give it the required resources and it will engineer your success.
7. Your character and attitude towards others are major factors in determining your end goal.
8. What you wish to achieve in life is just around the corner, you just have to be brave enough to go for it.
9. We are blessed by the Most High, so give thanks always and count your blessings.
