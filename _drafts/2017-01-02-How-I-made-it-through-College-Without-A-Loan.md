Hi All, Happy New Year and I wish for you and your family all the best for the new year.

This is my second blog post and I wish to share my experience on how I made it through University without a Loan. It is often said that Education is the key, rightly so. Based on [Find Research confirming the major reason for not attending teritary education][] One major challenge affecting the realiastion of this dream is the financial burden it place on families. On the brighter side the opportuniteis which it affords you or your family are tremendous and we should make every the effort to grasping it with both hands. As [Person said] [Find a Jamaica quote on Teritary Education] Teritary education is an integral part of the country's development. Despite the high cost, there are ways an means of achieving that goal by capitilising on some of the resources available by the governement, NGOs and Private Sector. 

[Find statistics showing how much % of teritary education is subsize]()


If you wish to not read the entire story, here is a quick summary highlighting the sequence of events & my thought processes:
1. Benefitted from the National Youth Service Program (20% of tuition for 3 years)
2. Benefitted from the JAMVAT Program (30% of tuition)
3. Recieved Scholarship programs.
4. Recieved support from family members.

Please not, this is by no-means me being boastful, I am merely showing proof that there are alternative & more cost effective ways of funding your teritary education without the use of loan programs in Jamaica. So I humble apologise to anyone who may view this content differently.


**Family Background**

So let me provide some background before you start assuming that my parent(s) is/are wealthy or they started saving beforehand in preparation for Teritary education. None of the above, not even close. I grew up in the cool cool hills of Clarendon in a single parent home. My dad played the role of both parents (true hero). He is a small scale farmer: rearing cattle and cultivating small crops was our main form of food. Am essentially saying we survived on less than $500/day (validate by calculating the cost of food at that time). Essentially we had to struggle to make ends meet even though it was only two of us.


**Final Years of High School**

In my fourth year of Clarendon College High School, at this time I was almost through the gate and I started thinking about University and my career path. By this time I had realized that my only option was to make the best of my remaining time. Knowing that I had no money to fund my teritary education and as such I started research programs which provides scholarship. While doing my summer job through the National Youth Service I learnt of their education 20% program. At this time I also heard about: JNCB scolarship program, Clarendon College Scholarship Program (your high school may offer one), VMBS Scholarship programs, and the popular SLB. 

Fast forward to the end of sixth form, reality had set in, all my friends were matritriculating into either UWI, NCU ect. At this point I had gotten through to UWI and the SLB was the only option I had steering me in the face. I wanted to know the pros and cons of using this loan program, here was what I found:
1. Two guarentors were required (Major problem for me)
2. The interest rate was 12% per annum starting from the day you signed the agreement.
3. I had no guarented job, after my studies.

After compunding those findings with a few calculation I realised that I will be spending the next 10-20 years, paying back a huge dept. In [2006](Validate and Identify the status of the economy) were were in difficult enconomic conditions. Living on ~$500/day, I could not mentally justify borrowing ~$1.9million not to mention the reprucussions which may arose after making the wrong decision.

**Finding the Alternative**

So I turned down the SLB option, and differed my university acceptance letter. I truly believe that the SLB cannot be the only way I my to fund my education. My mojo got dewildered as the sad feeling swept over me as the friends I had known for 6 years were going on to university and I was left behind. So by this time I was determined to make it even if that means delaying my education for a year. I truley believed that there were another way of getting higher education without signing away the little freedom I had. All those financial-aid programs I had known about I went and apply to a few of them. In [2007](Need to validate) was enrolled in the NYS program for 6 months (Thank you Lord). Upon successful completetion, this is a guaranted 20% for 3 years. Now motivated that I can still realize my dream, I then applyed for a HEART program called [School Leavers Training Opportuninty Programme (SL-TOP)](https://www.facebook.com/HEARTTrustNTA/posts/10151039703326962). Even though they are geared towards transforming graduates into the job market, I utilized the opporutinity to learn and grow from experts and gained invaluable insights into the working world.

The other pogram which made my dark path lit up and increase the possiblity of futhuring my studies was the [JAMVAT program](Link to the JAMVAT). They will offer up to 30% of your tuition on a yearly basis provided that you are qualified. This option only requires 1000hours of voluntary service. 

By this time I had a guaranted 20% from NYS, and an assume ungauranteed 30% from JAMVAT in total will be 50% of my goal. I then now realised that I need to go get help from my family members. So I humbly went to my uncles and aunts seeking support for the remaining capital. One agreed to provide me with the support I so badly needed. There you have it, 100% funding with God, hard work and time.

**College Life and the Realities**
A little side note: attending UTECH felt like I was in a foreign land: very expensive, but my visit was for a worthy cause.

By a few weeks in my first semester, my prayers were answered, I was selected for the JAMVAT scholarship program. Now I was able to fund 50% of my tuition cost at least for a year. My celebration was short lived as I then had to figure out how I may fund my daily expenses. This was the time I proved Mr Kyiasoki's theory, if you need it your mind will find a way to achieve it. Beyond just setting up a budget I had to find ways and means of saving and earning. The money I had saved while doing the SL-TOPs & NYS came to my rescue on multiple occassions. And for that I can't stress enough the importance of saving for a rainy day. 

As the years progressed, so is the level of difficulty. The environment became a true stress test of one's potential - my grandmother use to say "Yuh wah good, yuh nose haffi run". By the end of my third year I was faced with another challenge. The NYS program only lasted for three years by then I was faced with another challenge. No, I didn't know what was my next move. However it so happened that I my obsession with computers and my field of study landed me a scholarship. This is the next major lesson: Following what you believe and love does yield results. 

**Spend Drifting To The End**
Every money spent up to this point, had to be a necessity. Graduation ($17,000 + $2,500 photo shoot) wasn't considered a necessity as I saw that it as a last ditced effort by the institution to capitalise on a celebration. Instead, I purchased a well needed pair of shoes then I travelled home & celebrated with my father.

**Lessons Learnt**
And that is how I made it through four years of university without using the SLB program. 
Here are some of the lessons learnt:

1. Hard work and dedication are the secrets used in unlocking life's hidden treasures.
2. Whatever the mind can concieve you can surely achieve it.
3. Despite the high cost of teritary education, we are blessed for a couple of reasons: 1. It has been heavily subsidized by the Jamaican Government. 2. There are multiple NGOs, scholarships, grants available to help you on your journey.
4. Often times the first/easier options aren't the best choice. Alternative paths do exists, you just have to find them.
5. Never let your past decides your future, only let it be a lesson.
6. Your mind is a powerful tool, give it the required resources and it will engineer your success.
7. Your character and attitude towards others are major factors in determining your end goal.
8. What you wish to achieve in life is just around the corner, you just have to be brave enough to go for it.
9. We are blessed by the Most High, so give thanks always.
