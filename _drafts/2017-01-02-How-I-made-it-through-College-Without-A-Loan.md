Hi All, Happy New Year and best wishes for you and your family.

This is my second post and I wish to use this opportunity to sharing my experience as to how I made it through university without any form of loan or debt. It is often said that Education is the key, and rightly so. But the main issue facing most families is the high cost of tertiary education and there are many researches done to support this fact. On the brighter side, the opportunities which it affords you and your family are tremendous and we should make every effort to grasping it with both hands. According to [CAPRI's Research (2007)](http://www.capricaribbean.com/sites/default/files/public/documents/briefing_paper/funding_tertiary_education_in_jamaica.pdf){:target="_blank"} tertiary education is an integral part of our development and the government have put measures in place in an effort to increase it's affordability. I am therefore encouraging individuals to capitalise on these opportunities to further their education by utilizing the resources available. The government is not the only institution offering assistance; there are other non-profit organsiations and private sector entities offering their support. Speaking of assistance, the [Jamaica Tertiary Education Commission (J-TEC)](http://jtec.gov.jm/scholarships){:target="_blank"} contains valuable information on their website pertaining to tertiary institutions and various types of assistance - this brings me to the first lesson I've learnt while I was on this journey: 

> Information is key and the onus is on your to find it.

<br/>

If you wish to not read the entire epistle, here is a quick summary highlighting how I achieved my goal debt free:

1. First reason is the Most High who guided my path.
2. Benefitted from the [National Youth Service Program](http://www.nysjamaica.org/){:target="_blank"} (20% of tuition for 3 years)
2. Benefitted from the [JAMVAT](http://www.moe.gov.jm/sites/default/files/JAMVAT%20Overview.pdf){:target="_blank"} Program (30% of tuition).
3. Received Scholarship programs.
4. Received support from family members.

Please note that my only intentions are to provide real proof as to how I achieved tertiary education without the use of a loan and also to highlight a more cost effective option. If your interpretation of this content is different from the message I wish to convey, I humble apologise for any inconvenience caused and welcome your feedback.

**Family Background**


So let me provide some background before you start assuming that my parent(s) is/are wealthy or they started saving beforehand in preparation for tertiary education. None of the above, not even close. I grew up in the cool cool hills of Clarendon in a single parent household. My dad played the role of both parents, a true hero. He is a small-scale farmer: rearing cattle and cultivating small crops for survival. Am essentially saying we survived on less than ~$300JMD per day and we had to struggle to make ends meet even though it was a single parent household.

<br/>

**The Journey Begins: My Final Years at High School**

Jump to my fourth year at Clarendon College High School, at this time I was almost through the gates and I started thinking seriously about university and my career path. By this time I had realized that my only option was to make the best of my remaining years. Knowing that I had no money to fund my tertiary education, I started to research ways of funding this venture. While doing my summer job at Chapelton Public Hospital, through the [National Youth Service (NYS)](http://www.nysjamaica.org/){:target="_blank"} summer program, I learnt of the NYS 20% education program. During the same time I also heard about: JNCB scholarship program, Clarendon College Scholarship Program (your high school may offer one as well), VMBS Scholarship programs, and the popular [Student Loan Bureau (SLB)](http://www.slbja.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Fast forward to the end of sixth form, reality had set in, as all my friends were ready to matritriculate into either UWI, NCU, Knox or Cuba University. At this point I had gotten through to UWI and the SLB was the only option I had steering me in the face. I wanted to know the pros and cons of using this loan program so I did some research and here were some of the findings:

1. Two guarantors  were required (Major problem for me)
2. The interest rate was [12%](http://www.slbja.com/annualreports/SLB-Annual-Report-2011-2012.pdf){:target="_blank"} per annum starting from the day you signed the agreement.
3. I had no guaranted job, after my studies.

Side note: Since then the SLB has made signification improvements, ranging from reducing interest rates to 9% and [**payments on the reducing balance**](https://www.slbja.com/news.detail.aspx?DetailID=85){:target="_blank"}.

Ok back to my story, after compunding those findings with a few calculations I realised that I will be spending the next 10-20 years, paying back a huge dept. In [2006-2007](http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/economics-statistics/annual-economic-review/annual-economic-review-2006/jamaica/AER2006_Jamaica.pdf){:target="_blank"} the enconomy was reviving but in my neck of the woods, the only revival I knew was a church by that name. Also living on ~$300 per day, I could not mentally justify borrowing ~$1.5million without having a solid payment plan. That lead me to also think about the possible repercussions of choosing the wrong career path and the impact on my life and not to mention my dad.

<br/>
**Finding the Alternative**

As you guess it, I turned down the SLB option, and [deferred](http://admissions.utah.edu/apply/deferment/){:target="_blank"} my university education for a year. I truly believed that the SLB couldn't have been the only option available to fund my education. My decision was a lonely one, as my "mojo" got bewildered. Then the sad feeling swept over me as my friends were moving on to university and I was left behind. Even though I was stiff-headed, I forced myself in accepting the facts and looked forward to greater things. I truly believed that there were another options of getting higher education without signing away my little freedom given to by our national heroes (the bible also advice against debt - [Proverbs 22:7](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-7.htm){:target="_blank"})

Then came the time for action: so I went and applied to some of the financial-aid programs I had done research on. The NYS was the first program I was accepted into and in 2007 I was enrolled in their 6 months program (Thank you Lord). Upon successful completion yielded a guaranteed 20% for 3 years on my tuition, HOORAAY! As you can image, my "mojo" went through the roof as my dream started to get closer. I then applied for a HEART program called [School Leavers Training Opportuninty Programme (SL-TOP)](https://www.facebook.com/HEARTTrustNTA/posts/10151039703326962){:target="_blank"}. Even though they are geared towards transforming graduates into the job market, I utilized the opportinity to learn and grow while I gained invaluable insights into the working world.

The other program, which made my path brighter and increased the possiblity of furthering my studies was the [JAMVAT program](http://scholarshipjamaica.com/jamvat-scholarship/){:target="_blank"}. This program offers up to 30% of your tuition on a yearly basis provided that you are qualified. This option only requires 1000 hours of voluntary service at a public institution or non-profit organisation.

By this time I had a guaranteed 20% from the NYS, and an ungauranteed 30% from JAMVAT, now I'm half way (50%) there - somewhat. I then realised that I needed some financial support from my family members. So I humbled my self and went to my uncles and aunts seeking support for the remaining capital. After I presented my idea along with my assumed 50%, one agreed to provide me with the support I was in need of. There you have it, 100% funding with God's help, hard work and time. This was where I learnt the next lesson: 

> People are more willing to offer their assistance, if you show proof that you've been working hard.

<br/>

**College Life and the Realities**

A little side note: attending UTECH was more like visiting a first world country: expensive, beautiful and I felt misplaced but my visit was for a worthy cause.

A few weeks in my first semester, my prayers were answered, I was selected for the JAMVAT scholarship program. Now I was able to fund all of my tuition cost at least for a year. My celebrations were short lived, as I then had to figure out how I'll be funding my daily expense. This was the time I realised that if you really need it, your mind will find a way to achieve it. Under pressure, my mind engineered my first budget and I then found ways and means of saving and earning. Fortunately, the money I had saved while doing the SL-TOP & NYS came to my rescue on multiple occasions, as I had to purchase the necessary tools for my studies. Friends, for that I can't stress enough the next lesson:

> Saving for a rainy day is very important. 

<br/>

As the years progressed, so was the level of difficulty. The environment became a true stress test of one's potential - my grandmother once said "If yuh wah good, yuh nose haffi run". "My nose was running", as by the end of my third year I was faced with another financial challenge. The NYS program only lasted for three years, this means that my 20% cushion will be no more. At this point I really had no clude as I didn't knew what my next move was. However it so happened that I my obsession with computers and my field of study landed me a scholarship. Yes! it was so unexpected that I went on the student's portal multiple times checking if it was an error with my financial balance. This brings me to the next major lesson: 

> Following what you believe in and it will yield the results you desire.

<br/>

**Watching My Final Expenses**

Horray! At this point I was at the end of my four years at UTECH and every money spent up to this point, had to be justified. Graduation was the next money guzzler, and yes I questioned if it was a need or a want. I opted not to spend ~$19,500 on graduation ceremony ($17,000 fee + $2,500 photos shoot). Instead, I purchased a well-needed pair of shoes then I travelled home & celebrated with my father. 

<br/>

**Lessons Learnt**

So that was how I made it through four years of university without using the SLB program or any other form of loan. 
Here are some of my key takeaways:

1. Hard work and dedication are the secret tactics to unlock the hidden treasures of life.
2. Whatever the mind can conceive you can surely achieve.
3. Despite the high cost of tertiary education, we are blessed for a couple of reasons: 
	
	a. It has been heavily subsidized by the Jamaican Government - [according to Gleaner, the government pays approximately 80% of your tuition ](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100816/lead/lead2.html){:target="_blank"}

	b. There are multiple NGOs, scholarships, and grants available to help you on your journey - [J-TEC](http://jtec.gov.jm/scholarships){:target="_blank"} 

4. Often times the first or popular option isn't the best choice. Finding the alternative option may yield better results.
5. Never let your past decide your future, only let it be a lesson.
6. Your mind is a powerful tool, give it the required resources and it will engineer your success.
7. Your character and attitude towards others affects their perception of you, so do good and good will follow you.
8. Your success is just around the corner, you just have to be brave enough to go for it.
9. We are blessed by the Most High, so give thanks always and count your blessings.
